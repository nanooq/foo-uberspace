Documentation and configuration of our uberspace account used for mailing mostly

## Uberspace 
We have been with https://uberspace.de for a long time and had our private accounts there since at least 2012. And Uberspace has constantly gotten better in all criteria we have:
* _WTF?_ You pay as much money you want. We had no money back then and uberspace was our localhost in the web.
* _Support+_ The team consists of ~~four~~ ~~five~~ six members. Hardened system administrators
* _:Community:_ Entangled in many important communities, in example the Chaos Computer Club. We actually meet with them occassionally, but are too shy to talk to these wizards. 
* List could go on for ever.

## Foo
Overtime we hosted too much for uberspace disks, so we had to re-locate stuff. What stays with uberspace is the whole e-mail stuff. 

# Configuration
* E-Mail
  * Spam
    * mailfilter
